            <h1>RestClientGeneric Example</h1>
            <p>RestClientGeneric is a simple API, but under the hood, the API emits a level of complexity in order to maintain satisfying performance for the server side application.</p>
            <p>This API performs the mapping of a JSON to an entity when making a request to the server. This serialization process does not use reflection, which guarantees a performance when compared to the resource. The converse also proceeds, being able to transform an object or a set of objects to receive data from the application's Backend.</p>
            <p>Another way to guarantee performance is that this API works by caching data from the browser, within localstorage, which can also be contracted by the developer.</p>
            <p>This API is capable of handling requests following the main verbs of the Http protocol, and still performs the sending of files.</p>
