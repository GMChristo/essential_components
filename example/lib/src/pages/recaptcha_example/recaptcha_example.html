            <h1>Essential Recaptcha</h1>
            <p>This component helps to detect traffic is possible on your platform without any user friction. it returns a score based on interactions with your application that provides flexibility to perform the appropriate actions.</p>
            <h2>How is the mechanism behind this component?</h2>
            <p>in fact, take a breakthrough in risk analysis and adaptive challenges to prevent automated software from engaging in abusive activities on your platform. Thus, purely human defined users can easily pass.</p>
            <h2>How to user?</h2>
            <p>The component body itself, there are 3 important properties that must be set as default: <code>[key]</code> , <code>[verify]</code> and <code>[auto-render]</code>. They are the basic configuration base, as shown in the example.</p>
            <p><code>Key:</code> It is the key collected in the Google developers environment.</p>
            <p><code>Verify:</code> It is an event that mimics an answer whether it is True or False. for example, you can use a form to validate the presence of humans, if it is true, the form goes through the validation step.</p>
            <p><code>Auto-Render:</code> this property is intended to render the component automatically. the developer can by nature set it to true, but if he doesn't want to automatically render, he can make the validation engine work, only after saving a certain form. Therefore, it is necessary to define this property as false.</p>
            <h2>Important</h2>
            <p>An error can be generated not integrating the component, as a list of authorized domains needs to be configured in the Google development area. After that, it is necessary to get the key site_key, as well as the secrete_key, and defined in a variable within the logical area of your component.</p>
